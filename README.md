# A comparative study of text encryption using cryptographic algorithms.
• Comparison of various text encryption algorithms are performed based on a plethora of
parameters such as key size, time complexity, security.
• A GUI is designed from the implementation of the research for user-based preferences.
• JavaFX is used for the implementation of the project.
